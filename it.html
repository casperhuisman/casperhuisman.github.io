            <h1>Mining ancient texts</h1>
            
            <p>
                "In order to be able to outline the development of Pan’s characteristics even further, I have created several scripts enabling<br>
                me to compare eighteen texts in which Pan is mentioned. The result is a word cloud for each of these texts in which words close <br>
                to the word ‘Pan’ are compared with the other texts for their unicity (appendix 1). To do this, the first of the nine scripts uses <br>
                the retrieved texts from the ‘Perseus Digital Library’ website. Within these texts, the word ‘Pan’ has been searched, and the 40 <br>
                words around ‘Pan’ were isolated. These 40 words are called the ‘context’ of the word ‘Pan’ in that text. Within these ‘contexts’,<br>
                all words will be counted, to create a ‘term frequency’ (TF) per ‘context’. Words occurring many times within one ‘context’ will, <br>
                therefore, have a higher frequency. <br><br>
                The next step involves ‘weighing’ the words for their importance to a text. To do this, the ‘inverse document frequency’ (IDF) <br>
                needs to be calculated. Finally, the ‘TFIDF’ is calculated by multiplying the two, giving each word in each context an own ‘score’. <br>
                A higher score means that a term occurs many times within one context, and very little in all the other contexts, therefore, words <br>
                with high TFIDF numbers imply a strong relationship with the document in which they occur. While the score-tables (app. 2) list the <br>
                fifteen highest scoring words paired with their respective TFIDF scores, the word clouds (app. 1) visualise these scores, with the <br>
                words scoring highest being the largest. We can see very clearly, for example, that the word ‘song’ was associated with Pan in the<br>
                Homeric hymn to Pan, while it does not occur very prominently in any of the other texts."
